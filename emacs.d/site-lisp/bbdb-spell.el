;;; bbdb-spell.el --- export bbdb record to spell dictionary
;;; From: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-emacs-sources/2011-12/msg00007.html
;;;       See also: http://kanis.fr/blog-emacs.html

;;; Commentary:

;; This is version 1.2

;; This code will export your bbdb entries to your spell personnal
;; dictionary. To run the export run the following command
;;
;; M-x bbdb-spell-export
;;

;;; THANKS:
;;
;; Roland Winkler for constructive criticism
;; Mark Simpson for letting me know it didn't work with 2.35

;;; BUGS:
;;
;; Save your personal directory before running this program. I had my
;; dictionary truncated while debugging. It shouldn't happen but
;; better be safe than sorry...

;;; INSTALLATION:

;; Of course you need to have bbdb installed.
;; Put this file in your path an have the following in your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'bbdb-spell)
;;
;; Alternatively you can use autoload.

;;; Code:

(require 'ispell)
(require 'bbdb)
(require 'bbdb-com)

;; Support for version 2.35
